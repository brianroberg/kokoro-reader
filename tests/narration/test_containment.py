"""Containment (spec: "Containment tests"): a planted article carries hidden
instructions, and whatever a session inserts or rewrites on their account, finish
refuses it and the runner's gate holds it, even when the finish record claims a
clean recording. An honest session with the same article publishes, with exactly
the notes it earned. Everything goes through the HTTP app, on the fake engines."""

"""Word-preservation check (spec: "Quality gate", step 2).

The prepared text must say exactly what the article says. Formatting,
paragraph breaks, pauses and [BREAK] markers are invisible here. The server's
gate and finish additionally compare the engine's own phoneme output
(gate.speech_matches, over apply() below); this module is the fast, explainable
pre-check.

Both texts are read as the engine receives them: text_to_speech.clean_markdown_text
(the cleaning the CLI and KokoroEngine apply), then every run of whitespace other
than a newline made one plain space (as KokoroEngine does: misaki misplaces an
override after a no-break, thin or ideographic space or a tab on the same line),
then prepare_for_tts (which turns "--" into "... " before generate_audio hands
the text to misaki). Nothing else is done to the characters: no Unicode
normalisation (a fullwidth "＄" is not "$"). The only other edits are to drop [BREAK] markers, read a phonetic
override as its displayed word, and read a curly apostrophe as a straight one,
as misaki does.

Each run of non-whitespace characters is split into tokens, following what
misaki (the engine's grapheme-to-phoneme step) was checked to voice:
- numbers. A "-", "." or "-." right before the digits is part of the number at
  the start of the run, or after any character that is neither part of a word
  (a letter, a digit, or an apostrophe right after one) nor another "-" or
  ".": "-5", "(-5", "fell(-5", "5;-6", "'-5", "$-5", ".5" and "-.5" are not "5",
  but "..5", ".-5", "x-5" and "x'-5" read "five", and the hyphen in "5-6" is a
  range. An apostrophe next to a digit is dropped, as misaki drops it: "5'6"
  is "56" ("fifty-six") and "1990's" is "1990s";
- dotted words with no space ("example.com", "U.S.", "e.g."), one token each;
- the dotted abbreviations of misaki's lexicon, matched case-sensitively, which
  keep their dot (DOTTED_ABBREVIATIONS: "No. 5" is "number five", "No 5" is "no
  five"; a lowercase "no." is plain "no");
- words, and every other character on its own.
A run with a symbol in it (a character that is none of those and not silent:
"$", "%", "/", "≤") is one token, its silent marks gone: "$(-5)" is "$-5" and
"(5%)," is "5%". So any change of spacing around a symbol is a change ("≤-5"
is "less five", "≤ -5" "less or equal to minus five"), even where misaki reads
the two alike ("$.5" and "$ .5"). All tokens must match, in order, on both
sides; only the silent punctuation the engine doesn't voice (SILENT) is free.

Bounds on the work. Cleaning and tokenizing take time linear in each text's
length. Before any search, the check refuses a prepared text longer than twice
the article plus 10,000 characters, more than MAX_SUBSTITUTIONS substitutions,
an original longer than MAX_SPOKEN_WORDS words, and more prepared words (m)
than the article's (n) plus added_words_limit(n). Then finding each original in
the article takes at most n x MAX_SPOKEN_WORDS comparisons, and the alignment
settles at most 50 x (n + m) + 1000 states, each against at most
MAX_SUBSTITUTIONS substitutions found beforehand (a little under a millisecond
per article word in the worst case measured). A word of a substitution's spoken
side or of an override is at most 64 characters, and only words of at most 64
letters are compared as respellings.

Accepted residuals, where misaki and the check still differ:
- misaki deletes a minus glued after "+ × % @ § © ∞ ~ = < ^ ‰ _ ` – >", after a
  run of apostrophes, and after a comma glued to a word or a digit ("rose,-5",
  "5,-6"), where the check keeps it: "5" to "<-5" is refused though it sounds
  the same, while a minus deleted that way passes ("-5" to "<-5", "fell -5" to
  "fell_-5", "×-5" to "× -5", "rose, -5" to "rose,-5");
- the other way, dots before a sign and a quote between the sign and the digits
  make misaki say a minus the check doesn't see ("..-5" and "-‘5" read "minus
  five", here "5"), or drop the number;
- dashes in a run with a currency sign: "$5-6" reads "five dollarssix" and
  "$5–6" "five six", the same token here; the review found "5$-" can add a
  "dollar" that "5$" lacks, also the same token here;
- misaki sometimes drops a "-5" entirely (after a quote, a colon or an em dash);
- zero-width characters: misaki reads some as spaces ("five\u200bdollars" is
  "five dollars"); here they are symbols, so edits around them are refused;
- "No." before a newline reads "no" (misaki reads each line on its own), and a
  lowercase "no." before a number reads "number" ("no. 3"), while here "No." is
  always "no." and "no." always "no" (DOTTED_ABBREVIATIONS is case-sensitive);
- URLs: paths, ports and "@" ("example.com/news" has no "dot") are not modelled;
- "'05" ("zero five") and "’05" ("five") are the same token here;
- case is folded, though a case change can change the speech ("us" and "US",
  "NO. 3"), because the skill uses capitals to steer pronunciation;
- ".'5" reads "point five" in misaki, "5" here;
- a silent mark glued to a year can switch misaki from "twenty twenty-three" to
  "two thousand twenty-three";
- misaki garbles "-$3.50" and ranges such as "10,000-20,000";
- override phonemes are not checked to say their word here; the agent tools
  check their provenance (agent_tools.finish).
And the check refuses some edits the engine reads the same way (a sentence-final
"No." turned into "No,", "Dr." into "Dr", "1,000" into "1000", spacing around a
symbol, an override joined by a hyphen to a digit or to nothing, "5-[x](/…/)"),
since a refusal only costs a retry.

A phonetic override is validated for shape (one displayed word, a pronunciation
with a letter, no whitespace, limited length, no [BREAK] marker inside it, since
the engine splits the text there) and must stand alone, a whole,
separately spaced word with at most an opening bracket or quote before it and
closing punctuation after it, or a hyphen joining it to a letter (a name such as
"Ocasio-[Cortez](/…/)" or "[Pengelley](/…/)-Smith"), since misaki misplaces one
that shares a token with anything else. Its phonemes are not checked to say that word: an override
can pronounce any single word. The server validates override provenance
separately (Task 4).

Every change to the words themselves must be declared as a Substitution, and
declared substitutions are bounded so they can't carry new content: each one is
short, must replace some of the article's words (set aside the words both sides
share at the start and the end, and something of the original must be left: "long"
to "long subscribe now" only adds words, and is refused), may not add a web or
e-mail address, a path or a dotted word the article doesn't have ("www.evil.example"
would otherwise be one word), and across the whole text all of them together may
add only a few words and change only a few words, however many times each is applied. Only a
respelling is free of the second budget, and "respelling" is a syntactic
notion here (same letters spaced differently, or two long, very alike words),
not a judgment that the sounds are the same, so respellings are capped by
number too, and the published notes list every substitution and a reader can
see what was changed.

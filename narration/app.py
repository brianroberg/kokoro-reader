"""The narration HTTP app: two MCP servers behind one bearer-token gate.

/agent/mcp serves the six agent tools, each resolving its work item from the
caller's per-item token; /runner/mcp serves open, finalize and status, and
/runner/files/{item_id}/episode.mp3 the finished MP3, both for the runner token;
/health is open. BearerAuth checks every token before a request reaches a route,
and matches absolute paths, so the app must not be served under a root path.

The tool schemas are the agent's first feedback, so they are built from
agent_tools' own rules (ISSUE_KINDS, WHERE_RE, MAX_*, VOICE_RE, _plain) rather
than copies of them; agent_tools enforces the same rules again on every call.

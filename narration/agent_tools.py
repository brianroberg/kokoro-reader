"""The six tools an agent session has. Plain functions over a work item;
the HTTP layer resolves the item from the caller's token (agent never names it).

Every tool holds its item's lock for the whole call. The SDK runs sync tools in
worker threads, and two parallel record calls at round 3 would otherwise both
pass the limit. A call that finds the lock held is refused, not queued. Every
read-modify-write of the item's state.json happens inside that lock.

An override's phonemes must come from the phonemes tool. words.check reads a
[word](/phonemes/) override as its displayed word and can't know what the
phonemes say, so a session could voice anything under the override's length cap.
So phonemes() takes one plain word (never link syntax, which misaki's
preprocessing would read as an override and echo back) and records every lookup
in the item's state, and finish accepts an override only if its phonemes are
what a lookup returned for its displayed word, or for a respelling of it
(words.is_override_respelling) that the call declares as a substitution, so the published
notes list it. Every declared substitution must be used, and declared once.

The claims finish accepts are about the text that was recorded: record keeps the
sha256 of the exact text it handed the engine (state["recorded_sha256"], which
the gate checks too), and check and finish refuse once prepared.md differs from
it. outcome "hold" is always accepted, whatever was recorded or checked: nothing
held is published.

validate_finish (the shapes of a finish call), recording_claims (what it claims
about the recording) and validate_substitutions (what its substitutions must
satisfy) are module functions because the gate runs them again
on the stored finish record: one implementation, so the gate can't refuse what
finish accepted, nor the other way round. For the same reason finish runs the gate's
speech comparison (gate.speech_matches) for outcome clean or minor, so a session
learns before finalize that the engine would say something the article doesn't."""

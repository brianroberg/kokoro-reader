"""The authoritative pre-publish gate (spec: "Quality gate").

finish accepts outcome clean or minor only when its claims hold; the gate checks
them again on the files as they are at finalize time, with the code finish uses
where it can, so it can't publish what finish would have refused, nor refuse what
finish accepted:
- the finish record has the shapes finish allows (agent_tools.validate_finish:
  only an issue's kind and timestamp, and each substitution, reach the notes);
- the latest record round left a recording, of the text prepared.md holds now
  (state["recorded_sha256"]), and a check of that round returned a report (a
  failed check is counted in checks_used but has no entry) whose pre-check found
  nothing, no truncation and no long silence (agent_tools.recording_claims, the
  code finish runs);
- the prepared text says what the article says, with exactly the declared
  substitutions, and every override's phonemes came from a lookup
  (agent_tools.validate_substitutions, the code finish runs);
- the engine would say the same for the prepared text as for the article with
  those substitutions and the prepared text's overrides (speech_matches, which
  finish runs too). The word check can't fully mirror how misaki reads signs,
  symbols and abbreviations; this compares misaki's own output. A G2P that fails
  raises, as in finish: the runner retries, and nothing is decided.
An agent's outcome "hold" is a hold, whatever else is true: nothing held is
published, so its claims aren't checked, as finish doesn't check them. Pure,
apart from the G2P it is handed."""

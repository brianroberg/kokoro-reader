# The narration server

`python -m narration` serves two MCP endpoints behind one bearer-token gate:

- `/agent/mcp` has the six tools an agent session records an article with: `get_text`, `replace_text`, `record`, `check`, `phonemes` and `finish`. Each session has its own token, made when the work item is opened and revoked at `finish`.
- `/runner/mcp` has `open`, `finalize` and `status`, for the runner only (the runner token). `GET /runner/files/{item_id}/episode.mp3` serves a finished MP3, also for the runner token.
- `GET /health` is open and returns `{"ok":true}`.

On the Mac it runs as one LaunchAgent, `net.robergb.narration`, from the template in `deploy/net.robergb.narration.plist`.

## Install on the Mac

The plist assumes the checkout is at `~/tools/kokoro`. If it is somewhere else, change `WorkingDirectory` in the plist first.

```bash
cd ~/tools/kokoro && git pull && uv sync
mkdir -p ~/.config/narration ~/Library/Logs/narration ~/narration-data
openssl rand -hex 32 > ~/.config/narration/runner-token; chmod 600 ~/.config/narration/runner-token
tailscale ip -4          # put this address in place of TAILNET_IP in the plist
cp deploy/net.robergb.narration.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl bootstrap gui/(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/net.robergb.narration.plist
curl -s http://(tailscale ip -4):8770/health      # {"ok":true}
```

(`(id -u)` is fish syntax. In bash, use `$(id -u)`, and `$(tailscale ip -4)` for the address.)

`TAILNET_IP` appears twice in the plist, in `NARRATION_HOST` and in `NARRATION_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. Replace both in the copy in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`, after the `cp` and before the `launchctl bootstrap`, so the checkout stays clean.

The server exits at startup if `GEMINI_API_KEY` is unset. Keep it in the checkout's `.env`, which `load_dotenv` finds from the package's location, or add it to the plist's `EnvironmentVariables`.

The logs are `~/Library/Logs/narration/out.log` and `err.log`. The runner token is the file `~/.config/narration/runner-token`. It goes to the deploy of the runner (Plan 3) and never travels through chat.

To restart after a `git pull`: `launchctl kickstart -k gui/(id -u)/net.robergb.narration` (bash: `$(id -u)`). To remove it: `launchctl bootout gui/(id -u)/net.robergb.narration`.

## Check it from the home server's container

```bash
curl -s http://brians-macbook-pro:8770/health      # {"ok":true}
```

This reaches the Mac over the tailnet. The name must be in `NARRATION_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (with the port), or the server answers 421.

## Settings

The server reads these from its environment (the plist's `EnvironmentVariables`).

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `NARRATION_RUNNER_TOKEN_FILE` | none: required | A file holding the runner's bearer token: one line, ASCII, no spaces or control characters. The server exits at startup if it can't use it. |
| `NARRATION_DATA_DIR` | `~/narration-data` | Where work items are kept, one folder per article. |
| `NARRATION_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | The address to listen on. The plist sets the Mac's tailnet address. |
| `NARRATION_PORT` | `8770` | The port to listen on. |
| `NARRATION_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `127.0.0.1:PORT,localhost:PORT` | Comma-separated `host:port` values a request's `Host` header may have (the DNS-rebinding guard). A request with any other Host gets 421. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | none | The verifier's key, from the environment or `.env`. Not needed with `--fake-engines`. |

## Never run it behind a root path

Never start the server with `--root-path` (or any root path setting). The bearer-token gate matches absolute request paths (`/health`, `/agent/...`, `/runner/...`), so a root path would move the requests out from under the gate. `python -m narration` takes no such option, and the plist must not add one. If a reverse proxy is ever put in front, it has to strip any prefix before the request reaches the server.

## What an agent session must do (a summary for the skill)

The server's instructions and tool descriptions say all of this to the agent. A skill that drives a session (Plan 3) should say it too:

- **One tool call at a time.** A call made while another is still running for the same work item is refused.
- **Re-record after any edit.** The recorded text is hashed. After any `replace_text`, `check` and `finish` (outcome `clean` or `minor`) refuse until `record` has run again. There are at most 4 record rounds and 8 checks per article, and a round counts even if the engine fails. Once the checks are used up, `record` is refused (a new round could not be checked), so the last checked round stands.
- **Never change what the article says without declaring it.** Every word change in the prepared text is a substitution in `finish` (`original`, `spoken`, optional `why`), declared once. Each must replace some of the article's words: one that only adds words (`long` read as `long subscribe now`) is refused, and so is one whose spoken side adds a web or e-mail address, a path or a dotted word the article doesn't have. All of them together may add only a few words.
- **A respelled pronunciation lookup is a substitution.** If the agent looks up a respelling of a word with `phonemes` (Pengelly for Pengelley) and uses those phonemes in the word's override, it declares that in `finish` as a substitution: `original` the word, `spoken` the respelling.
- **Overrides only from `phonemes()`.** A pronunciation override is `[word](/phonemes/)` with exactly the phonemes `phonemes(word)` returned. Phonemes written by hand are refused at `finish`.
- **`record` returns `speech_warnings`:** places where the engine would say something the article doesn't. Read them before spending a check, fix them with `replace_text` (most often by moving or removing a pause), and record again. `finish` (outcome `clean` or `minor`) and the runner's gate refuse the same mismatches. When the prepared text's words differ from the article's, nothing is compared at `record` (substitutions are declared only at `finish`), and `speech_warnings` holds one entry saying so.
- **A pause after some words changes how the engine reads them.** The engine reads "to", "in", "the" (before a vowel) and "am" differently when a pause follows them. So a pacing edit (a comma, a dash or a pause mark) right after one of these words can change the sound, and may be flagged in `speech_warnings` and then refused at `finish`. A skill should tell the agent to put pauses elsewhere, or to take the pause out again.
- **`finish` ends the session** and revokes its token. `clean` needs the latest round recorded from the prepared text as it is now and checked with no pre-check warnings. `minor` and `hold` list at least one remaining issue. `hold` needs no claims about the recording, and nothing held is published.

## Tests

The tests run without the Apple Silicon stack (no `mlx_audio`, `torch` or `spacy`). This is the light test command:

```bash
uv run --no-project --with "mcp==2.3.0" --with uvicorn --with httpx --with hypothesis --with pytest \
  --with numpy --with soundfile --with pydub --with "audioop-lts; python_version >= '3.13'" \
  --with google-genai --with python-dotenv \
  python -m pytest tests/narration tests/test_verify_audio.py -q
```

`tests/narration/smoke_claude.sh` is a manual end-to-end check, not part of pytest: it starts the server on fake engines (port 8771, or `SMOKE_PORT`), opens a work item, and has a real `claude -p` session with only the six tools record it. It needs `claude` logged in and costs a few cents. Run it with `bash tests/narration/smoke_claude.sh`.
